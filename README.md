## How to use
To use this applcation, you will need to do the following:
1.  Install the Violentmonkey extension (or similar, e.g, Tampermonkey (never tested it here)
2. There are three files included here, pinterest.js, savepin-with-query.js, savepin-no-query.js, for each file create a new script for it in ViolentMonkey and paste the contents of each file accordingly & save.
3. Open a pinterest board or nested board
4. Enable the downloader, & Enjoy!

### Please Note
By default most browsers prevent pop up windows from being opened, you as the user has to allow pinterest.com & https://www.savepin.app to open new tabs or popups (the downloader will not work without this)

## Why does it exist?
I do Art, and Pinterest is essential for getting reference images & inspiration, only problem is, when i'm offline I cant go to Pinterest. Either way, downloading images from Pinterest one by one can be time consuming and its just not worth it, especially if you need to download a large volume of pins. 

There are some extensions available, but the one I found at the time required a subscription, so I decided to build my own downloader that addressed my needs. I've been learning UX/UI Design & Front End Development as well, so this little project was a great chance to apply that knowledge, this downloader has saved me time, and that's why I just had to share it with you!
