## How to Use

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Install the [Violentmonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) (or a similar extension like Tampermonkey, if you prefer).
2. You'll find three files included here: [pinterest.js](https://github.com/rrokutaro/Pinterest-HD-Board-Downloader-Widget/blob/main/pinterest.js), [savepin-with-query.js](https://github.com/rrokutaro/Pinterest-HD-Board-Downloader-Widget/blob/main/savepin-with-query.js), and [savepin-no-query.js](https://github.com/rrokutaro/Pinterest-HD-Board-Downloader-Widget/blob/main/savepin-no-query.js). Create a new script in ViolentMonkey for each file, paste the respective file's contents, and save them.
3. Open a Pinterest board or [nested board](https://za.pinterest.com/rrokutar/human-figure/wierd-forms/).
4. Enable the downloader and enjoy!

## Please Note

Most browsers block pop-up windows by default. You may need to allow pinterest.com and https://www.savepin.app to open new tabs or pop-ups for the downloader to function properly.

## Why Does It Exist?

As an artist, Pinterest is crucial for sourcing reference images and inspiration. However, it's not always accessible when offline. Downloading images one by one can be time-consuming, especially for a large volume of pins. Although some extensions are available, I found that they often required a subscription. This motivated me to create my own downloader that met my needs. Additionally, I've been learning UX/UI Design and Front-End Development, and this project was an excellent opportunity to apply that knowledge. The downloader has saved me time, and I wanted to share it with you!
