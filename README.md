# Pinterest HD Board Downloader Widget â€” by ROKUTARO.
Pinterest HD Board Downloader allows you to download pins from boards in the highest quality possible while on Pinterest! You can select pins (one by one), or select all visible pins, you can download currently selected pins or download the an entire board (since the pins are downloaded in the highest quality possible, data usage for downloading large boards can be large).

2. There are three files included here, <a href="https://github.com/rrokutaro/Pinterest-HD-Board-Downloader-Widget/blob/main/pinterest.js" target="_blank">pinterest.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rrokutaro/Pinterest-HD-Board-Downloader-Widget/blob/main/savepin-with-query.js" target="_blank">savepin-with-query.js</a>, &* <a href="https://github.com/rrokutaro/Pinterest-HD-Board-Downloader-Widget/blob/main/savepin-no-query.js" target="_blank">savepin-no-query.js</a>, for each file create a new script for it in ViolentMonkey and paste the contents of each file accordingly & save.

## Please Note
By default most browsers prevent pop up windows from being opened, you as the user has to allow pinterest.com & https://www.savepin.app to open new tabs or popups (the downloader will not work without this)

# Why does it exist?
I do Art, and Pinterest is essential for getting reference images & inspiration, only problem is, when i'm offline I cant go to Pinterest. Either way, downloading images from Pinterest one by one can be time consuming and its just not worth it, especially if you need to download a large volume of pins. 

There are some extensions available, but the one I found at the time required a subscription, so I decided to build my own downloader that addressed my needs. I've been learning UX/UI Design & Front End Development as well, so this little project was a great chance to apply that knowledge, this downloader has saved me time, and that's why I just had to share it with you!
